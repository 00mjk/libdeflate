Version 0.3:
	Some bug fixes and other minor changes.

Version 0.2:
	Implemented a new block splitting algorithm which typically improves the
	compression ratio slightly at all compression levels.

	The compressor now outputs each block using the cheapest type (dynamic
	Huffman, static Huffman, or uncompressed).

	The gzip program has received an overhaul and now behaves more like the
	standard version.

	Build system updates, including: some build options were changed and
	some build options were removed, and the default 'make' target now
	includes the gzip program as well as the library.

Version 0.1:
	Initial official release.
