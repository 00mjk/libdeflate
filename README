This is libdeflate, a free (public domain) library for fast, whole-buffer
DEFLATE compression and decompression.

The supported formats are:

	- DEFLATE (raw)
	- zlib (DEFLATE with zlib header and footer)
	- gzip (DEFLATE with gzip header and footer)

libdeflate is heavily optimized.  It is significantly faster than zlib, both for
compression and decompression.  In addition, at compression levels 8 and above
it provides a compression ratio better than zlib's, while still being about the
same speed as zlib's level 9.

libdeflate has a simple API that is not zlib-compatible.  You can create
compressors and decompressors, and use them to compress or decompress buffers.
There is not yet any support for streaming.  See libdeflate.h for details.

libdeflate is public domain; the author claims no copyright on it.
